				<h1 id="butwhy"> But why <br> does this <br> problem <br> exist? </h1>
				<p class="yellowtext"> In an interview from 2014 with It’s Nice That, Rebecca Wright, who is the program director of graphic communication design at Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts London, she asserts that in certain parts of the graphic design industry, mostly higher up, “confidence, charisma and chutzpah” are valued over “equality and pluralism.” What it boils down to is that women are less likely to want to assert themselves in the workplace the way men do. There are several reasons for that in itself– like centuries of female opression within the workplace, the idea of gendered jobs, and personality traits. <br> <br> Wright has over 15 years of design education experience and even more experience as a woman in the industry. She has seen, or possibly experienced, the ways in which women are less likely to “self-promote.” So the problem is not that women are not great designers or cannot get jobs in the industry after graduating, it’s that there is an underlying structure and expectation of “fanfare” and bravado that correlates with climbing the ladder. This structure has been established by men, who are used to and encourage these qualities. This leads to a “lack of visibility” for women that do not mirror these qualities once they are out of design school and in the workplace. <br> <br> Wright also states that the problem could begin in design school itself. There are little to no courses on the culture and attitude of the graphic design industry, including the “issue of gender” and “cultural machismo” that still reigns supreme. It is important to also note that this issue is not unique to the graphic design industry. The underlying structure of patriarchy and emphasis on traditianlly male qualities exists in nearly every other industry. </p>
